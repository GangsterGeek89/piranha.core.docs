# Access Archives and Posts

This tutorial explains how to access Archives and the corresponding Posts.

## Getting an Archive using the IApi

Archive pages are just a special kind of page that are used for structuring posts, categories and tags. The page `Id` is the key that is referenced in the field `BlogId` on the posts.

The Archive Page model can be loaded from the `IArchiveRepository` and load posts from **one** archive, with the option to filter on time period, category or tag.


## Getting Post of an Archive using the IApi

All posts are stored in the `Piranha_Posts` table and can be accessed from the `PostRepository` in the `IApi` using `IApi.Posts`. Each post has a foreign key `BlogId` that specifies which Archive Page it belongs to.

You can access posts directly by calling the `IPostRepository` in the `IApi`

1. This will get **all** Posts from **all** Archive Pages materialized as their different types:
    ```csharp
    var allPosts = api.Posts.GetAll<Piranha.Models.PostBase>();
    ```
2. This will get **all** Posts from a **single** Archive Page materialized as their different types.
    ```csharp
    var archivePosts = api.Posts.GetAll<Piranha.Models.PostBase>(archivePageId);
    ```
Requesting Posts as `PostBase` (an abstract base class) will in fact get **all** Post types.
You can filter the returned Post by the Post type:

```csharp
// This gets all post types
var allPosts = api.Posts.GetAll<Piranha.Models.PostBase>();

// This gets all posts without regions & blocks
var smallPosts = api.Posts.GetAll<Piranha.Models.PostInfo>();

// This gets just a specific post type
var somePosts = api.Posts.GetAll<MySpecificPostType>();
```

## Advanced queries with using the DbContext

If you need to do advanced queries you can query the `DbContext` directly by injecting `Piranha.IDb` into you class. 
If you're using cache it is recommended to select the `Id` of the posts and then retrieve them through the `IApi` as posts will be cached.

Here is an example for retrieving the ten latest Posts from all Archives:

```csharp
var tenLatestPostsFromAllArchives = db.Posts
    .Where(p => p.Published >= DateTime.Now)
    .OrderByDescending(p => p.Published)
    .Take(10)
    .Select(p => p.Id)
    .ToList();

var posts = new List<Piranha.Models.PostBase>();
foreach (var id in tenLatestPostsFromAllArchives)
{
    posts.Add(api.Posts.GetById<Piranha.Models.PostBase>(id);
}
```
Instead of `Piranha.Models.PostBase` you can as well take other types as mentioned above.

If you have full cache enabled, `GetById` will be cached and the posts will only be fetched from the database the first time. 
If you can't use caching you can also do more advanced queries to actually select the data using the `DbContext` and transform them using the `ContentService`.
